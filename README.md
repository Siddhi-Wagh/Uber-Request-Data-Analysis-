# Uber-Request-Data-Analysis

Project Summary

This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride request data to identify and address key operational challenges related to driver availability, trip cancellations, and unfulfilled ride requests. The dataset includes crucial variables such as request timestamps, pickup points (city or airport), driver IDs, trip status, and drop timestamps. The findings will serve as a foundation for data-driven recommendations to improve service efficiency, balance supply with demand, reduce cancellations, and enhance the overall customer experience. The project ultimately supports Uberâ€™s goal of optimizing its operations through actionable insights derived from its own ride data.

The insights derived will help inform strategic decisions to:
- Improve customer experience
- Reduce service gaps during peak hours
- Optimize driver deployment
- Minimize ride cancellations

Business Objective

To analyze Uber ride request data in order to identify trends in demand and driver availability, understand service failures, and provide data-driven recommendations to enhance operational efficiency, increase trip fulfillment, and reduce cancellations.

Tools & Technologies used:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
  
Key Insights:
- There is a clear mismatch between demand and driver availability.
- There are more requests for airport pickups than city trips, and a high percentage of unfulfilled airport requests due to no cars being available.
- Many rides are cancelled by customers between 5 AM and 9 AM, likely due to delays or unavailability.
- Trip durations are longer during early morning and evening peaks.
